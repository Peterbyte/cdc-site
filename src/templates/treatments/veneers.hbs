			<p>Veneers are a thin layer of porcelain or composite that are placed over damaged or discoloured teeth. The result is the toothâ€™s appearance is very much improved.</p>

			<h4>Procedure</h4>
			<p>A small amount of tooth is removed from the front surface of the tooth.</p>
			<p>An impression is taken of this and sent to the lab. The veneer returns 2 weeks later and fitted to the tooth with a resin glue and set with a curing light.</p>

			<h4>Benefits</h4>
			<p>Very little tooth is removed. The procedure can be done without local anaesthetic in some cases.</p>
			<p>The appearance of the teeth after treatment is very beautiful.  Discolouration, imperfections, stains and old fillings can be hidden.</p>
			<p>Veneers have a protective function against acids in the diet and body that would otherwise wear the teeth and cause sensitivity.</p>
			<p>We do a procedure called a SMILE LIFT. This involves numerous veneers on the front teeth. The results are always very beautiful. This is a very common cosmetic procedure at our clinic.</p>
