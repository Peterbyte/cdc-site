			<h4>What are they?</h4>
			
			<p>This is a permanent and aesthetic means of replacing a missing tooth or teeth.</p>

			<p>A titanium screw is surgically placed into the jaw bone, where a tooth or teeth are missing.</p>

			<p>Titanium osseointegrates. This means that bone actually grows onto the surface of the implant, resulting in a very stable fixture. We then place an abutment on the implant and then fabricate a crown.</p>

			<p>Treatment can take between 3-6 months. In some cases we can restore the implants immediately.</p>

			<p>Occasionally we may need to perform a graft if the bone is inadequate. This is a simple procedure and is usually carried out at the same time as placing the implant. Bone particles are placed around the defect and implant.</p>

			<p>We always carry out a thorough examination and radiographs and produce a report before commencing any implant treatment.</p>

			<h4>Benefits</h4>
			<p>This treatment is for those individuals with missing teeth, loose dentures and for whom all other options are unrealistic. A classic situation is the individual who has suffered with the loose lower denture. A very stable implant retained denture can increase the quality of life of the patient. Some patients do not want healthy teeth drilled and opt for implant treatment.</p>
